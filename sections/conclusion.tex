\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented a design and implementation of sized types for Coq.
Our work extends the core language and type checking algorithm of prior theoretical work on sized types for CIC with pragmatic features found in Coq, such as global definitions, and extends the inference algorithm to infer sizes over completely unannotated CIC terms to enable backward compatibility.
We implement the design presented in this paper as an extension to Coq's kernel\blindimpl.
The design and implementation can be used alone or in conjunction with syntactic guard checking to maximize typeability and compatibility.
