\section{Reduction, Convertibility, Takahashi Translation}\label{sec:red-conv-trans}

\input{figures/reduction-full.tex}

\autoref{fig:reduction-full} lists the complete definitions for all reduction rules, including our new rules for $\delta$- and $\Delta$-reduction.
Notice that in fixpoints, the $n_m$th recursive argument needs to be an applied constructor, while cofixpoints can only be reduced as a case expression target.
These conditions are required for strong normalization.
However, this restricted cofixpoint unfolding causes issues with subject reduction~\cite{cc-hat-omega}.
\autoref{fig:reduction-full-unrestricted} presents an alternate unrestricted nonterminating $\nu'$-reduction of cofixpoints outside of case expressions so that subject reduction holds at the cost of normalization.

We define $\reduce$ as the least compatible closure of $\reduce_{\beta\zeta\delta\Delta\iota\mu\nu}$, $\reduce_n$ as the $n$-step reduction of $\reduce$, and $\reduce^*$ as the reflexive--transitive closure of $\reduce$.
Convertibility ($\approx$) is the symmetric closure of $\reduce^*$ up to $\eta$-expansion, and is formally defined in \autoref{fig:conversion}.

The Takahashi translation $e^\dagger$ of a term $e$~\cite{takahashitrans} is used in our proof of confluence.
Informally, we define it as the simultaneous single-step reduction of all $\beta\zeta\delta\Delta\iota\mu\nu$-redexes of $e$ in left-most inner-most order.
We further define $e^{n\dagger}$ as the $n$-step Takahashi translation of $e$.
